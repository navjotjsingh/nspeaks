If you haven't heard, Google Chrome browser is going to deprecate certain addons which use the Manifest v2 framework. Google can give whatever excuse they want but the actual reason behind deprecating Manifest v2 based extensions is that it is used by popular adblockers. The most popular adblocker, UBlock Origin, is one of the addon that will be affected by this rule.

There is an alternative extension that uses Manifest v3 which is what Google wants all addons to adopt from hereon, called UBlock Origin Lite. However, the lite version is severly lacking in support for custom filters because of the way Manifest v3 specifications. And there is nothing much that can be done.
