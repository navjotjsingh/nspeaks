**Note:** If your browser supports JPEG XL, you will see the image with the text saying it supports JPEG XL. Else, you will see a fallback JPEG image.

## What is JPEG XL?

JPEG XL is a next-generation image codec being in the process of being standardized by the JPEG Committee. It separates itself from other newer formats like WebP, AVIF, and HEIC as it is not based on any video codec like they are. This gives it an advantage as it has been specifically made to display images and offers much better quality and smaller file sizes than any other codec.

## How to convert your photos to JPEG XL format?

The easiest way to convert your photos to JPEG XL format is to use online converter apps.

1. **[Squoosh App](https://squoosh.app)**. It can be installed as a native PWA app on phones and web browsers. It can only convert one file and offer various quality settings along with a live preview.
2. [**jpegxl-converter**](https://jpegxl-converter.com/) - can convert one file at a time and offers lossless encoding along with quality settings. Lossless compression might not work with large files, though.
3. [**MConverter**](https://mconverter.eu/convert/to/jxl/) - It works very similarly to Squoosh and can be installed as a native app as well. It supports file sizes up to 500 MB.
