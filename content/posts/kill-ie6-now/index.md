**Update**: I have removed a lot of broken links. Some of the sites are still insecure. Also, this is 2022. IE 6 is already dead.

Yes, finally I have decided to Kill Internet Explorer 6 on my blog. If you are using IE 6 or a lower browser, you will now be asked to upgrade to a newer version of Internet Explorer. It's not that my site does breaks in IE 6 but because IE6 time is up. I am not asking you to upgrade to browsers other than IE but to a newer IE which is easy to upgrade to, works better and displays lots of sites and is easier to work for me as a webmaster.

Here is the screenshot of what will you see when you open site in IE6:

If you are using IE 6, probably you would have noticed many sites asking you to upgrade including YouTube, Orkut and Facebook. Recently the movement to kill IE 6 has speeded with the launch of [IE6nomore](https://www.ie6nomore.com) - an initiative by [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/). It is providing with a code which will ask users to upgrade to Firefox, IE 8, Chrome or Safari( left Opera - too bad). There are many other sites who are pushing hard to kill IE 6 which include:

- [IE Death March](http://iedeathmarch.org/) - is a blog which tells you a lot about shortcomings of IE 6 and advantages of upgrading.
- [Browser Upgrade](http://www.browserupgrade.info/) - is another site which asks users to upgrade to Firefox 3 preferably and provides tools too. It also mentions about Opera, Safari and Google Chrome.
- [IE6 Upgrade Warning](http://code.google.com/p/ie6-upgrade-warning/) - is a Google Code project providing with a script which asks users to upgrade from IE6. It supports all major browsers as options for upgrade.
- [Sevenup](http://code.google.com/p/sevenup/) - is the most unusual site which provides tool to upgrade both IE6 and IE7. Not only it provides upgrade options but lists the reasons to upgrade via a Light box effect window.

Above are some of the sites. I may have missed few too. So when are you planning to kill IE6 on your website?

And by the way if you have already killed IE6 on your website, do add your site's name at [I dropped IE6](https://idroppedie6.com/). And finally [Microsoft is not going to drop support for IE6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ie/engineering-pov-ie6) anytime soon.
