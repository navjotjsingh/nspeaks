summary: I have finally ported my blog from WordPress to Hugo
---

After trying to blog for 15 years using WordPress, I feel it is time to try a different platform. Though this is not the first time I have tried something different. In the past, I have used [Ghost](https://ghost.org/ "Ghost Blogging Platform") and [Hexo](https://hexo.io/ "Hexo Static Site Generator"). While both of them have their own benefits, I wanted to try something new.

Welcome [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo Static Site Generator")! It is a static site generator written in [Go language](https://go.dev/). This means, it come packaged as a single executable file with no dependencies which makes running, and updating it that much easier. I am still learning more about it's features and template system. Over time, I will keep updating my site to incorporate the best that Hugo has to offer.

So far, I have managed to successfully copy over the posts and images over to Hugo. I have gone through and fixed broken images, and links. The next step would be to convert older images to WebP format to further reduce the overhead.

I will also blog about tips and tricks about Hugo that I learn along the way. Here's hoping that I will write more going forward.
