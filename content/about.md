Who is N?

N Stands for me i.e. Navjot Singh. I am a 38-year-old guy from India and this blog is my attempt to share whatever I have learned over the years. Earlier, it used to be about blogging and money-making but of late I have shifted the focus on sharing tutorials and tips on subjects that interest me. Hereâ€™s hoping you will find some use for it.

I have written tutorials for Linode, Vultr, Howtoforge, Envato, Snel, and WPWebhost. If you are looking for a Linux tutorial for your website, you can reach out to me at navjot@nspeaks.com.
